What is OpenURL ?
Open URL
The OpenURL standard is a protocol for transmission of metadata describing the resource that you wish to access.
If your
librarian
has set up your subscription with an OpenURL resolver, OpenURL links appear automatically on the abstract pages.
You can define your own OpenURL resolver with your
EDP Sciences Account
.
In this case your choice will be given priority over that of your library.
More information about Open URL's can be found here:
https://www.oclc.org/productworks/urlresolver.htm
Please check this box if you accept to receive commercial information.
In accordance with the January 6, 1978 French data protection act called "Loi Informatique et Libertés", all users have access to data held on themselves and are entitled to have this data corrected or deleted.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Where can I get best information on 30-m global cropland project and products?
A: Croplands.org (this website) is best for visualizing the data that the team has produced
    over the past few years.  You may also go to our official USGS website for additional information
    regarding methods, algorithms, workshops, and publications.

Q: Where can I download the 30-m Landsat derived global cropland extent product?
A: All our data and products are released with proper documentation through LP DAAC.
    Currently, 30-m Landsat derived global cropland extent product is available for visualization and comments at croplands.org.
In the coming months, we will make this data available for download at LP DAAC.The product will be distributed in 10
    degree by 10 degree tiles for the entire world.
Q: If the 30-m global cropland extent product is ready with accuracies, then why is it not
    instantly released?
A: It is true that the final version of the 30-m global cropland extent product is ready
    with accuracies. However, we can only release the data through proper peer-reviewed documentation. The peer-review
    process takes time and we are trying to expedite this as much as we can. Please be patient. Our goal is too to
    release it ASAP.
Q: Are there any downloadable data on global croplands?
A: Yes! We now have two remote sensing derived cropland products at nominal 1-km resolution
    that you can download from LP DAAC. Direct links to these:
1.) Nominal 1-km crop dominance product for nominal year 2010:

Q: What are the applications of the 30-m global cropland product?
A: The GFSAD30 has many applications in agriculture, water, and food security studies.
    First, the cropland extent product is the highest resolution cropland product covering the entire world. Second, it
    is used to derive cropland areas of different countries as well as sub-national statistics of cropland areas. Third,
    the cropland extent product is a baseline data for all higher level products such as irrigation versus rainfed,
    cropping intensities, crop types, and cropland fallows. Fourth, croplands consume nearly 80% of all human wate

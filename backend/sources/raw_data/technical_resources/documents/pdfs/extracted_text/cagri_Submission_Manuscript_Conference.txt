Submission to Cahiers Agricultures of a manuscript
adapted from a paper already presented at a conference
Can you submit to Cahiers Agricultures a manuscript adapted from a paper already presented
in a conference?
There are various possible cases:
1) Your paper was presented in a conference but was not published in the conference
proceedings on a website, or the abstract only was published.
In this case, you can submit your manuscript to Cahiers Agricultures.
2) Your paper was presented in a conference and was published in its entirety in the
conference proceedings or on a website.
• If the presentation was published under copyright or if you have assigned your
copyright on the text to the publisher, you must ask the publisher for permission to re-
use it.
• If the presentation was published under a Creative Commons license, you have the
right to re-use it (check the terms according to the type of license).
In these two cases, you must inform Cahiers Agricultures (mentioning it in your cover letter),
that a first version of your text was presented at a conference (title, place and date). You must
cite in your manuscript the complete bibliographic reference of this first publication, with its
DOI or URL if applicable.
In any case, your manuscript must be re-edited beforehand in order to comply with the
instructions to authors of Cahiers Agricultures. As with any manuscript, it will be submitted to
peer review and you will probably be required to modify it according to the comments of the
reviewers.
If you chaired or organized a special session in a conference, grouping together several papers
dealing with the same scientific question, you can also propose a thematic issue on this
question to publish all or part of these papers. Please contact us for more details.

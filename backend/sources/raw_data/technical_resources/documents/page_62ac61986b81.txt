The GFSAD is a NASA funded project (2023-2028) to provide highest-resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food-and-water security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat-series, Sentinel-series, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics from 2000 to 2030
Monitoring global croplands is imperative for ensuring sustainable water and food security to the people of the world in the Twenty-first Century. The currently available cropland products suffer from major limitations such as:
Absence of precise spatial location of the cropped areas;
Coarse resolution nature of the map products with significant uncertainties in areas, locations, and detail;
Uncertainties in differentiating irrigated areas from rainfed areas;
Absence of crop types and cropping intensities; and
Absence of a dedicated web\data portal for the dissemination of cropland products.
Thereby, the
overarching goal
of this NASA MEaSUREs GFSAD project is to develop global or large area agricultural cropland products at fine spatial resolution of 30m or better using multiple satellite sensor time-series data, big data analytics, machine learning and cloud computing in support of global food and water security in the twenty-first century.
Specific objectives
will be to produce four distinct cropland products for nominal years 2020 and 2025. The study will make use of a fusion of Landsat-8, 9, and Sentinel-2A&2B (S2) surface reflectance (SR) products already available in GEE, and NASA’s Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Landsat product (HLSL30) for 2013-present and HLS Sentinel-2 product (HLSS30) for 2015-present, that together have sub-5-days global coverage
(Masek, et al., 2021, 2022)
at nominal 30m resolution (Figure 4). These products are:
1.
Landsat-derived Global cropland extent product @ 30m (LGCEP30-2020, LGCEP30-2025).
2.
Landsat-derived
Global rainfed & irrigated product @ 30m (LGRIP30-2020, LGRIP30-2025).
3.
Landsat-derived Global cropping intensity product @ 30m (LGCIP30-2020, LGCIP30-2025).
4.
Landsat-derived Global crop type product @ 30m for USA & Canada, and India (LGCTY30-2020USACAN, LGCTY30-2025USACAN, LGCTY30-025India).
The HLSL30 has 10 bands (aerosol, B, G, R, NIRnarrow, SWIR1, SWIR2, cirrus, TIR1, TIR2), and the HLSS30 S2 derived product has 13 bands (aerosol, B, G, R, RE1, RE2, RE3, NIRbroad, NIRnarrow, SWIR1, SWIR2, water vapor, cirrus) (Masek, et al., 2022) along with F
mask
cloud mask band and other quality layers. In the earlier global cropland extent product @ 30m (GCEP30) Landsat 8/16-day data were used to time-composite 10-band (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR, EVI, NDWI, NDVI) Landsat 30m data cubes for every 2-4 months over a 3–4-year period (for nominal year 2015) along with 2 additional 30m bands (SRTM elevation and slope). However, the HLSL30 and HLSS30 provide significant advances such as the sub-5-day (2-3 days optimal possible as per Masek et al., 2022) coverage, presence of red-edge bands, many possibilities of data transformations like the vegetation indices, and improved processing and consistency of the HLS data (Masek et al., 2022, Wulder et al., 2019, Roy et al., 2017). We will create analysis ready data (ARD) cubes utilizing these bands to best process each of the cropland products. The ARD cubes, processed in GEE, will involve these bands, their transformations (e.g., vegetation indices), and numerous ancillary data (e.g., climate).
Once the above products are established, other products such as the following can be derived using the above products and certain other inputs:
5) Crop productivity (productivity per unit of land; kg\m
2
)
6) Water productivity (crop per drop or productivity per unit of water; kg\m
3
).
The GFSAD has released two global products that can be downloaded from NASA's LP DAAC. These products are:

The spatial distribution of global cropland areas (~1.5 billion hectares) and five dominant crop types (wheat, rice, maize, barley and soybeans). This composite map was produced by Thenkabail and Gumma through spatial modeling involving remote sensing derived global irrigated and rainfed croplands (Thenkabail et al., 2011, 2009a, 2009b) and five dominant global crop types from other sources (Ramankutty et al. (2008), Monfreda et al. (2008), and Portman et al. (2009)). The 5 crops constitute about 60% of all global cropland areas. Cover page credits: Dr. Prasad S.

Hyperspectral signature bank of world’s major crops. The initial goal of a global cropland monitoring system should consist of developing hyperspectral signature bank of major world crops (e.g., this figure) along with crop phonologies (e.g., Figure 4) in order to: (a) establish improved models of crop biophysical and biochemical quantities, (b) increase crop classification accuracies, and (c) produce accurate crop and water productivity models. The six leading world crops (Table 1) cover 64% of the global cropland areas. Sample hyperspectral signatures of these six World crops are illustrated in the figure. The background image is irrigated and rainfed croplands of the world (Thenkabail et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2011).

Rice map of South Asia. Crop phenologies and intensities studied using time-series remotely sensed data illustrated for rice crop in South Asia. A clear and deep understanding of phenologies and intensities will require us to develop a temporal (e.g., this figure) and spectral knowledge base of each crop in different agro-ecosystems of the world leading to mapping distinct classes within a crop, which in turn will lead to accurate assessments of green water use (rainfed croplands) and blue water use (irrigated croplands).

Landsat-derived rainfed and irrigated-area product for conterminous United States for the year 2020 (LRIP30 CONUS 2020) using supervised and unsupervised machine learning on the cloud
Landsat-derived rainfed and irrigated-area product for conterminous United States for the year 2020 (LRIP30 CONUS 2020) using supervised and unsupervised machine learning on the cloud
Accurate maps of irrigated and rainfed croplands are crucial for assessing global food and water security. Irrigated croplands yield two to four times more grain and biomass than rainfed croplands. To meet rising food demand, the proportion of cropland that is irrigated must be increased globally. Because agriculture uses 80% to 90% of global fresh water, understanding changes in...

Global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution (GCEP30) derived from Landsat satellite time-series data for the year 2015 using multiple machine-learning algorithms on Google Earth Engine cloud
Executive Summary Global food and water security analysis and management require precise and accurate global cropland-extent maps. Existing maps have limitations, in that they are (1) mapped using coarse-resolution remote-sensing data, resulting in the lack of precise mapping location of croplands and their accuracies; (2) derived by collecting and collating national statistical data...

Mapping croplands of Europe, Middle East, Russia, and Central Asia using Landsat 30-m data, machine learning algorithms and Google Earth Engine
Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type, crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area defined as continental to global cropland mapping is challenging due to differential manifestation of croplands...

Mapping cropland extent of Southeast and Northeast Asia using multi-year time-series Landsat 30-m data using Random Forest classifier on Google Earth Engine
Cropland extent maps are useful components for assessing food security. Ideally, such products are a useful addition to countrywide agricultural statistics since they are not politically biased and can be used to calculate cropland area for any spatial unit from an individual farm to various administrative unites (e.g., state, county, district) within and across nations, which in turn...

Nominal 30-m cropland extent map of continental Africa by integrating pixel-based and object-based algorithms using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data on Google Earth Engine
A satellite-derived cropland extent map at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) is a must for food and water security analysis. Precise and accurate global cropland extent maps, indicating cropland and non-cropland areas, are starting points to develop higher-level products such as crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), cropping intensities (e.g., single, double, or continuous...

Spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and automated cropland classification algorithms (ACCAs) for mapping croplands of Australia using MODIS 250-m time-series (2000–2015) data
Mapping croplands, including fallow areas, are an important measure to determine the quantity of food that is produced, where they are produced, and when they are produced (e.g. seasonality). Furthermore, croplands are known as water guzzlers by consuming anywhere between 70% and 90% of all human water use globally. Given these facts and the increase in global population to nearly 10...

Overview
The GFSAD is a NASA funded project (2023-2028) to provide highest-resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food-and-water security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat-series, Sentinel-series, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics from 2000 to 2030
Monitoring global croplands is imperative for ensuring sustainable water and food security to the people of the world in the Twenty-first Century. The currently available cropland products suffer from major limitations such as:
Absence of precise spatial location of the cropped areas;
Coarse resolution nature of the map products with significant uncertainties in areas, locations, and detail;
Uncertainties in differentiating irrigated areas from rainfed areas;
Absence of crop types and cropping intensities; and
Absence of a dedicated web\data portal for the dissemination of cropland products.
Thereby, the
overarching goal
of this NASA MEaSUREs GFSAD project is to develop global or large area agricultural cropland products at fine spatial resolution of 30m or better using multiple satellite sensor time-series data, big data analytics, machine learning and cloud computing in support of global food and water security in the twenty-first century.
Specific objectives
will be to produce four distinct cropland products for nominal years 2020 and 2025. The study will make use of a fusion of Landsat-8, 9, and Sentinel-2A&2B (S2) surface reflectance (SR) products already available in GEE, and NASA’s Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Landsat product (HLSL30) for 2013-present and HLS Sentinel-2 product (HLSS30) for 2015-present, that together have sub-5-days global coverage
(Masek, et al., 2021, 2022)
at nominal 30m resolution (Figure 4). These products are:
1.
Landsat-derived Global cropland extent product @ 30m (LGCEP30-2020, LGCEP30-2025).
2.
Landsat-derived
Global rainfed & irrigated product @ 30m (LGRIP30-2020, LGRIP30-2025).
3.
Landsat-derived Global cropping intensity product @ 30m (LGCIP30-2020, LGCIP30-2025).
4.
Landsat-derived Global crop type product @ 30m for USA & Canada, and India (LGCTY30-2020USACAN, LGCTY30-2025USACAN, LGCTY30-025India).
The HLSL30 has 10 bands (aerosol, B, G, R, NIRnarrow, SWIR1, SWIR2, cirrus, TIR1, TIR2), and the HLSS30 S2 derived product has 13 bands (aerosol, B, G, R, RE1, RE2, RE3, NIRbroad, NIRnarrow, SWIR1, SWIR2, water vapor, cirrus) (Masek, et al., 2022) along with F
mask
cloud mask band and other quality layers. In the earlier global cropland extent product @ 30m (GCEP30) Landsat 8/16-day data were used to time-composite 10-band (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR, EVI, NDWI, NDVI) Landsat 30m data cubes for every 2-4 months over a 3–4-year period (for nominal year 2015) along with 2 additional 30m bands (SRTM elevation and slope). However, the HLSL30 and HLSS30 provide significant advances such as the sub-5-day (2-3 days optimal possible as per Masek et al., 2022) coverage, presence of red-edge bands, many possibilities of data transformations like the vegetation indices, and improved processing and consistency of the HLS data (Masek et al., 2022, Wulder et al., 2019, Roy et al., 2017). We will create analysis ready data (ARD) cubes utilizing these bands to best process each of the cropland products. The ARD cubes, processed in GEE, will involve these bands, their transformations (e.g., vegetation indices), and numerous ancillary data (e.g., climate).
Once the above products are established, other products such as the following can be derived using the above products and certain other inputs:
5) Crop productivity (productivity per unit of land; kg\m
2
)
6) Water productivity (crop per drop or productivity per unit of water; kg\m
3
).
The GFSAD has released two global products that can be downloaded from NASA's LP DAAC. These products are:

Hyperspectral signature bank of world’s major crops. The initial goal of a global cropland monitoring system should consist of developing hyperspectral signature bank of major world crops (e.g., this figure) along with crop phonologies (e.g., Figure 4) in order to: (a) establish improved models of crop biophysical and biochemical quantities, (b) increase crop classification accuracies, and (c) produce accurate crop and water productivity models. The six leading world crops (Table 1) cover 64% of the global cropland areas. Sample hyperspectral signatures of these six World crops are illustrated in the figure.

Landsat-derived rainfed and irrigated-area product for conterminous United States for the year 2020 (LRIP30 CONUS 2020) using supervised and unsupervised machine learning on the cloud
Accurate maps of irrigated and rainfed croplands are crucial for assessing global food and water security. Irrigated croplands yield two to four times more grain and biomass than rainfed croplands. To meet rising food demand, the proportion of cropland that is irrigated must be increased globally. Because agriculture uses 80% to 90% of global fresh water, understanding changes in...

Artificial neural network multilayer perceptron models to classify California’s crops using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) data
Artificial neural network multilayer perceptron models to classify California’s crops using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) data
Advances in remote sensing and machine learning are enhancing cropland classification, vital for global food and water security. We used multispectral Harmonized Landsat 8 Sentinel-2 (HLS) 30-m data in an artificial neural network (ANN) multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to classify five crop classes (cotton, alfalfa, tree crops, grapes, and others) in California's Central Valley. The...

Automated Cropland Fallow Algorithm (ACFA) for the Northern Great Plains of USA
Automated Cropland Fallow Algorithm (ACFA) for the Northern Great Plains of USA
Cropland fallowing is choosing not to plant a crop during a season when a crop is normally planted. It is an important component of many crop rotations and can improve soil moisture and health. Knowing which fields are fallow is critical to assess crop productivity and crop water productivity, needed for food security assessments. The annual spatial extent of cropland fallows is poorly...

Global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution (GCEP30) derived from Landsat satellite time-series data for the year 2015 using multiple machine-learning algorithms on Google Earth Engine cloud
Global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution (GCEP30) derived from Landsat satellite time-series data for the year 2015 using multiple machine-learning algorithms on Google Earth Engine cloud
Executive Summary Global food and water security analysis and management require precise and accurate global cropland-extent maps. Existing maps have limitations, in that they are (1) mapped using coarse-resolution remote-sensing data, resulting in the lack of precise mapping location of croplands and their accuracies; (2) derived by collecting and collating national statistical data...

Mapping croplands of Europe, Middle East, Russia, and Central Asia using Landsat 30-m data, machine learning algorithms and Google Earth Engine
Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type, crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area defined as continental to global cropland mapping is challenging due to differential manifestation of croplands...

Agricultural cropland extent and areas of South Asia derived using Landsat satellite 30-m time-series big-data using random forest machine learning algorithms on the Google Earth Engine cloud
The South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan) has a staggering 900 million people (~43% of the population) who face food insecurity or severe food insecurity as per United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). The existing coarse-resolution (>250-m) cropland maps lack precision in geo-location of...

Mapping cropland extent of Southeast and Northeast Asia using multi-year time-series Landsat 30-m data using Random Forest classifier on Google Earth Engine
Cropland extent maps are useful components for assessing food security. Ideally, such products are a useful addition to countrywide agricultural statistics since they are not politically biased and can be used to calculate cropland area for any spatial unit from an individual farm to various administrative unites (e.g., state, county, district) within and across nations, which in turn...

MODIS phenology-derived, multi-year distribution of conterminous U.S. crop types
MODIS phenology-derived, multi-year distribution of conterminous U.S. crop types
Innovative, open, and rapid methods to map crop types over large areas are needed for long-term cropland monitoring. We developed two novel and automated decision tree classification approaches to map crop types across the conterminous United States (U.S.) using MODIS 250 m resolution data: 1) generalized, and 2) year-specific classification. The classification approaches use...

Nominal 30-m cropland extent map of continental Africa by integrating pixel-based and object-based algorithms using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data on Google Earth Engine
Nominal 30-m cropland extent map of continental Africa by integrating pixel-based and object-based algorithms using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data on Google Earth Engine
A satellite-derived cropland extent map at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) is a must for food and water security analysis. Precise and accurate global cropland extent maps, indicating cropland and non-cropland areas, are starting points to develop higher-level products such as crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), cropping intensities (e.g., single, double, or continuous...

A 30-m landsat-derived cropland extent product of Australia and China using random forest machine learning algorithm on Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform
Mapping high resolution (30-m or better) cropland extent over very large areas such as continents or large countries or regions accurately, precisely, repeatedly, and rapidly is of great importance for addressing the global food and water security challenges. Such cropland extent products capture individual farm fields, small or large, and are crucial for developing accurate higher-level...

Spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and automated cropland classification algorithms (ACCAs) for mapping croplands of Australia using MODIS 250-m time-series (2000–2015) data
Mapping croplands, including fallow areas, are an important measure to determine the quantity of food that is produced, where they are produced, and when they are produced (e.g. seasonality). Furthermore, croplands are known as water guzzlers by consuming anywhere between 70% and 90% of all human water use globally. Given these facts and the increase in global population to nearly 10...

Automated cropland mapping of continental Africa using Google Earth Engine cloud computing
Automated cropland mapping of continental Africa using Google Earth Engine cloud computing
The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or...

Mapping rice-fallow cropland areas for short-season grain legumes intensification in South Asia using MODIS 250 m time-series data
Mapping rice-fallow cropland areas for short-season grain legumes intensification in South Asia using MODIS 250 m time-series data
The goal of this study was to map rainfed and irrigated rice-fallow cropland areas across South Asia, using MODIS 250 m time-series data and identify where the farming system may be intensified by the inclusion of a short-season crop during the fallow period. Rice-fallow cropland areas are those areas where rice is grown during the kharif growing season (June–October), followed by a...

This has become all the\nmore critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as\nregional and global development agendas.\nStatistical work has been at the core of the activities and mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (FAO) since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger,\nimproving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agrifood systems. FAO is a\nleading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered from\nnational statistical offices and from FAO’s network of partner agencies and are harmonized to paint a global picture.\nAll of these data are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook.\nThe Statistical Yearbook is a primary tool and indispensable reference for policymakers, researchers and analysts,\nas well as laypersons interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the\nwealth of information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication offers a synthesis\nof the major factors at play in the global food and agricultural landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic\nchapters, covering the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production;\nimplications for food security and nutrition; and agriculture’s impacts on the environment.\nThis year, special attention is given to the impact of disasters on agriculture, as new information from FAO now\nquantifies the magnitude of losses resulting from these events. FAO work on estimating food losses, which uses\nnon-conventional data sources, is also featured. Data on the cost and affordability of a healthy diet, which have\nbeen released recently in FAOSTAT, are showcased as well and provide a measure of economic access to nutritious\nfoods and healthy diets that are a key link between food security and nutrition. Finally, this edition of the Statistical\nYearbook highlights information on the structural characteristics of the agricultural sector coming from censuses of\nagriculture that users can now easily compare across countries and census rounds for the first time.\nThis Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The\nfreely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the\nworld, with approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 million\nviews each year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a\nquick and easy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture.\nIn addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO is also involved in strengthening the statistical capacity\nof countries so they can produce more and better data, set standards and methodologies, and leverage big data\ninnovations. FAO is committed to ensuring free access to current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to\nchart a course towards more sustainable and equitable agrifood systems and a world free of hunger.\nJosé Rosero Moncayo\nDirector, Statistics Division\nix\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis Statistical Yearbook was prepared by the Statistics Division (ESS) of\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in\ncollaboration with the Communications (OCC), Fisheries and Aquaculture\n(NFI), Forestry (NFO), Land and Water (NSL) and Markets and Trade (EST)\ndivisions.

This has become all the\nmore critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as\nregional and global development agendas.\nStatistical work has been at the core of the activities and mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (FAO) since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger,\nimproving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agrifood systems. FAO is a\nleading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered from\nnational statistical offices and from FAO’s network of partner agencies and are harmonized to paint a global picture.\nAll of these data are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook.\nThe Statistical Yearbook is a primary tool and indispensable reference for policymakers, researchers and analysts,\nas well as laypersons interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the\nwealth of information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication offers a synthesis\nof the major factors at play in the global food and agricultural landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic\nchapters, covering the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production;\nimplications for food security and nutrition; and agriculture’s impacts on the environment.\nThis year, special attention is given to the impact of disasters on agriculture, as new information from FAO now\nquantifies the magnitude of losses resulting from these events. FAO work on estimating food losses, which uses\nnon-conventional data sources, is also featured. Data on the cost and affordability of a healthy diet, which have\nbeen released recently in FAOSTAT, are showcased as well and provide a measure of economic access to nutritious\nfoods and healthy diets that are a key link between food security and nutrition. Finally, this edition of the Statistical\nYearbook highlights information on the structural characteristics of the agricultural sector coming from censuses of\nagriculture that users can now easily compare across countries and census rounds for the first time.\nThis Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The\nfreely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the\nworld, with approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 million\nviews each year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a\nquick and easy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture.\nIn addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO is also involved in strengthening the statistical capacity\nof countries so they can produce more and better data, set standards and methodologies, and leverage big data\ninnovations. FAO is committed to ensuring free access to current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to\nchart a course towards more sustainable and equitable agrifood systems and a world free of hunger.\nJosé Rosero Moncayo\nDirector, Statistics Division\nix\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis Statistical Yearbook was prepared by the Statistics Division (ESS) of\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in\ncollaboration with the Communications (OCC), Fisheries and Aquaculture\n(NFI), Forestry (NFO), Land and Water (NSL) and Markets and Trade (EST)\ndivisions.

This has become all the\nmore critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as\nregional and global development agendas.\nStatistical work has been at the core of the activities and mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (FAO) since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger,\nimproving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agrifood systems. This year marks\nthe eightieth anniversary of FAO, representing 80 years of statistical activity. Over this period, FAO has positioned\nitself as a leading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered\nfrom national statistical offices and from FAO’s network of partner agencies and harmonized to paint a global picture.\nThe most important FAO statistics are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook.\nThe Statistical Yearbook is a primary tool and indispensable reference for policymakers, researchers and analysts, as\nwell as for any person interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the wealth\nof information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication offers a synthesis of the major\nfactors at play in the global food and agriculture landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic chapters that\ncover the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production; implications for\nfood security and nutrition; and agriculture’s impacts on the environment. The digital version of the yearbook presents\nthe data in an interactive way, which facilitates the visualization of figures and tables and their reuse.\nAs we celebrate eight decades of statistical achievements, special attention is given to the centennial of the first World\nProgramme for the Census of Agriculture guidelines, as countries prepare their next agricultural census. Improved\ndata on forestry products trade, with the addition of processed wood and paper products, are also featured. Finally,\nthe prevalence of minimum dietary diversity, a new indicator for monitoring progress towards Target 2.2 of the\nSustainable Development Goals – End all forms of malnutrition – is showcased.\nThis Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The\nfreely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the world,\nwith approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 million views\neach year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a quick and\neasy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture.\nIn addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO also works towards strengthening the statistical capacity of\ncountries so they can produce more and better data; it sets standards and methodologies, and leverages innovations\nsuch as big data and other new data collection and processing technologies. FAO is committed to ensuring free access\nto current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to chart a course towards more sustainable and equitable\nagrifood systems and a world free of hunger.\nJosé Rosero Moncayo\nChief Statistician\nDirector, Statistics Division\nix\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis Statistical Yearbook was prepared by the Statistics Division (ESS) of\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in\ncollaboration with the Communications (OCC), Fisheries and Aquaculture\n(NFI), Forestry (NFO), Land and Water (NSL) and Markets and Trade (EST)\ndivisions.

This has become all the\nmore critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as\nregional and global development agendas.\nStatistical work has been at the core of the activities and mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (FAO) since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger,\nimproving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agrifood systems. This year marks\nthe eightieth anniversary of FAO, representing 80 years of statistical activity. Over this period, FAO has positioned\nitself as a leading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered\nfrom national statistical offices and from FAO’s network of partner agencies and harmonized to paint a global picture.\nThe most important FAO statistics are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook.\nThe Statistical Yearbook is a primary tool and indispensable reference for policymakers, researchers and analysts, as\nwell as for any person interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the wealth\nof information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication offers a synthesis of the major\nfactors at play in the global food and agriculture landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic chapters that\ncover the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production; implications for\nfood security and nutrition; and agriculture’s impacts on the environment. The digital version of the yearbook presents\nthe data in an interactive way, which facilitates the visualization of figures and tables and their reuse.\nAs we celebrate eight decades of statistical achievements, special attention is given to the centennial of the first World\nProgramme for the Census of Agriculture guidelines, as countries prepare their next agricultural census. Improved\ndata on forestry products trade, with the addition of processed wood and paper products, are also featured. Finally,\nthe prevalence of minimum dietary diversity, a new indicator for monitoring progress towards Target 2.2 of the\nSustainable Development Goals – End all forms of malnutrition – is showcased.\nThis Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The\nfreely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the world,\nwith approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 million views\neach year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a quick and\neasy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture.\nIn addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO also works towards strengthening the statistical capacity of\ncountries so they can produce more and better data; it sets standards and methodologies, and leverages innovations\nsuch as big data and other new data collection and processing technologies. FAO is committed to ensuring free access\nto current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to chart a course towards more sustainable and equitable\nagrifood systems and a world free of hunger.\nJosé Rosero Moncayo\nChief Statistician\nDirector, Statistics Division\nix\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis Statistical Yearbook was prepared by the Statistics Division (ESS) of\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in\ncollaboration with the Communications (OCC), Fisheries and Aquaculture\n(NFI), Forestry (NFO), Land and Water (NSL) and Markets and Trade (EST)\ndivisions.

Key concepts
Digitization: Digitization usually refers to converting Geographical Information System (GIS): A GIS is an
traditional information into data that can be processed by a agriculture-oriented data management platform or technology

documents into files on a computer disk, converting paper agriculture sector when the amount of data is large enough,
photos into image files, or converting a parameter in the taking into account the spatial characteristics of agricultural

computing and artificial intelligence (AI), need to penetrate
rural areas to narrow the digital divide. However, the
digitalization of agriculture is relatively difficult to implement Affordability

following three main issues:
4. - Positive factors
In order to overcome the above challenges, the necessary measures include:
Governmental support New technology Private investment
In the discussion and analysis of the following case, we will only discuss the main positive factors and will not mention the
influence of other minor elements due to time constraints. In addition, some external factors may become the main driving force
of an event. For example, e-commerce in China started with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003,
and after recently experiencing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic we are now looking to accelerate the process of
digitization in agriculture.
5. - About family farmers
In the value chain of the agricultural industry, family farmers
are in a relatively weak position. Efficient information flow
using digital tools can not only improve production efficiency
at the farm level, but also support the standardization of
production and the adding of value to agricultural products,
and efficiently organize family farmers to increase production
and supply.

The energy issues in facility agriculture operations can be mitigated by solar, wind, and bioenergy, which is in line with the
previously mentioned principle of integrating computing into the physical world.
In Digital Agriculture 4.0, facility agriculture is a more successful model because facilities are more like the devices with their
previously noted adsorption properties. Since facility agriculture involves large investments in equipment, users share the investment
costs of the digital equipment.
The counterpart of facility agriculture is outdoor crop growth, which is currently mostly at the level of mechanization and automation
and is difficult to digitize. Mature technology relies heavily on drones, satellites, navigation, and sensors attached to agricultural
machinery to further enhance the intelligence and digitalization of production.

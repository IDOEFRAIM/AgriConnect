FOREWORD
Timely, accurate and high-quality data and statistics are the cornerstone of solid policy design, where decisions are
based on hard evidence, and monitoring and evaluation rely on strong statistical systems. This has become all the
more critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as
regional and global development agendas.
Statistical work has been at the core of the activities and mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger,
improving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agrifood systems. FAO is a
leading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered from
national statistical offices and from FAO’s network of partner agencies and are harmonized to paint a global picture.
All of these data are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook.
The Statistical Yearbook is a primary tool and indispensable reference for policymakers, researchers and analysts,
as well as laypersons interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the
wealth of information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication offers a synthesis
of the major factors at play in the global food and agricultural landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic
chapters, covering the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production;
implications for food security and nutrition; and agriculture’s impacts on the environment.
This year, special attention is given to the impact of disasters on agriculture, as new information from FAO now
quantifies the magnitude of losses resulting from these events. FAO work on estimating food losses, which uses
non-conventional data sources, is also featured. Data on the cost and affordability of a healthy diet, which have
been released recently in FAOSTAT, are showcased as well and provide a measure of economic access to nutritious
foods and healthy diets that are a key link between food security and nutrition. Finally, this edition of the Statistical
Yearbook highlights information on the structural characteristics of the agricultural sector coming from censuses of
agriculture that users can now easily compare across countries and census rounds for the first time.
This Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The
freely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the
world, with approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 million
views each year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a
quick and easy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture.
In addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO is also involved in strengthening the statistical capacity
of countries so they can produce more and better data, set standards and methodologies, and leverage big data
innovations. FAO is committed to ensuring free access to current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to
chart a course towards more sustainable and equitable agrifood systems and a world free of hunger.

FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF DISASTERS ON AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY
Disasters are estimated to have caused production losses in crops and livestock valued at USD 3.8 trillion between 1991 and 2021, corresponding
to an average loss of USD 123 billion per year, or 5 percent of annual global agricultural GDP.1 Figure b1 presents the geographical distribution
and the economic impact of these losses. Asia has the largest loss (USD 1 720 billion), reflecting its overall geographic size, followed by the
Americas (USD 827 billion), Europe (USD 660 billion), Africa (USD 580 billion) and Oceania (USD 55 billion). Presenting the estimated losses
as a share of the agricultural GDP of the regions highlights the differentiated economic impact. The share of losses in agricultural GDP is the
highest in Africa (7.7 percent), followed by the Americas (7.5 percent), Europe (7.2 percent), Oceania (4.8 percent) and Asia (3.6 percent).
Even though Asia has the highest loss in absolute terms, it has a relatively small impact given the magnitude of its production. In contrast, Africa,
the Americas and Europe appear more affected proportionally to their agricultural sector.

The global production of vegetable
oils went up 125 percent between
2000 and 2020, to 208 million tonnes
in 2020 (see Figure 23 and Table 20).
This is 115 million tonnes more than
in 2000, but 4 million tonnes less
than in 2019. Palm oil registered the
largest increase, both absolute and
relative, as its production went up
54 million tonnes, or 241 percent;
it overtook soybean oil as the main
vegetable oil produced in 2006. The
use of palm oil for biodiesel explains
most of this spectacular growth.13
The other main vegetable oils
produced in 2020 are rapeseed oil,
accounting for 12 percent of global
vegetable oil production (down from
15 percent in 2000), and sunflower
oil, which accounted for 10 percent
of total vegetable oil production
(down from 11 percent in 2000).

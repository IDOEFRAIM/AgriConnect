FOREWORD
Timely, accurate and high-quality data and statistics are the cornerstone of solid policy design, where decisions are
based on hard evidence, and monitoring and evaluation rely on strong statistical systems. This has become all the
more critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as
regional and global development agendas.
Statistical work has been at the core of the activities and mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger,
improving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agrifood systems. This year marks
the eightieth anniversary of FAO, representing 80 years of statistical activity. Over this period, FAO has positioned
itself as a leading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered
from national statistical offices and from FAO’s network of partner agencies and harmonized to paint a global picture.
The most important FAO statistics are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook.
The Statistical Yearbook is a primary tool and indispensable reference for policymakers, researchers and analysts, as
well as for any person interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the wealth
of information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication offers a synthesis of the major
factors at play in the global food and agriculture landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic chapters that
cover the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production; implications for
food security and nutrition; and agriculture’s impacts on the environment. The digital version of the yearbook presents
the data in an interactive way, which facilitates the visualization of figures and tables and their reuse.
As we celebrate eight decades of statistical achievements, special attention is given to the centennial of the first World
Programme for the Census of Agriculture guidelines, as countries prepare their next agricultural census. Improved
data on forestry products trade, with the addition of processed wood and paper products, are also featured. Finally,
the prevalence of minimum dietary diversity, a new indicator for monitoring progress towards Target 2.2 of the
Sustainable Development Goals – End all forms of malnutrition – is showcased.
This Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The
freely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the world,
with approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 million views
each year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a quick and
easy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture.
In addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO also works towards strengthening the statistical capacity of
countries so they can produce more and better data; it sets standards and methodologies, and leverages innovations
such as big data and other new data collection and processing technologies. FAO is committed to ensuring free access
to current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to chart a course towards more sustainable and equitable
agrifood systems and a world free of hunger.

The global production of vegetable
oils went up 130 percent between
2000 and 2022 to 212 million
tonnes in 2022 (see Figure 25 and
Table 22). This is 120 million tonnes
more than in 2000, but 3 million
tonnes less than the peak observed
in 2021. Palm oil registered the
largest increase, both absolute and
relative, as its production went up
57 million tonnes, or 255 percent;
it overtook soybean oil as the
main vegetable oil produced in
2006. The use of palm oil for
biodiesel explains most of this
spectacular growth.13 The other
main vegetable oils produced in
2022 were rapeseed oil, accounting
for 27 million tonnes (13 percent
of global vegetable oil production),
and sunflower oil, accounting for
20 million tonnes (10 percent).
As with primary crops, the
production of the main vegetable
oils is heavily concentrated in a
handful of countries (see Figure 26).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report examines the multifaceted impact of the global food, energy, and finance crisis on Kosovo's
agricultural sector, focusing on key production factors (land, labor and capital), input use, yields, farm
profitability, sustainable farming attitudes, food security, migration trends, farming strategies, agricultural
competitiveness, and policy support perceptions.
The study employs a combination of survey data, sector-specific analyses, and stakeholder interviews
to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the crisis has reshaped the agricultural landscape
in Kosovo and to offer resilience and sustainability enhancing recommendations.
Impact on key production factors
The crisis has significantly affected farmers utilization of land, labor, and capital in Kosovo. Land use per
farm increased 8.7 percent, from 5.73 has in 2019 to 6.23 has in 2023, primarily through additional land
leasing to maintain flexibility amidst market volatility. Labor usage saw a modest rise of 6.4 percent, with
a notable 62.6 percent increase in full-time employed labor, reflecting efforts to secure a stable workforce
despite labor shortages and increased competition from other sectors. Wages for agricultural labor also
surged, with daily wages increasing by 57.9 percent and monthly wages
by 24.7 percent, exacerbating financial pressures on farmers.
Capital utilization was subject to adjustments because of soaring input costs; many farmers reduced
chemical fertilizer application and faced escalating machinery expenses due to high fuel prices. Despite
these challenges, farmers continued to invest an average of EUR 23 529 per farm in their operations,
indicating a proactive approach to enhancing productivity and adapting to market conditions. However,
over 90 percent of these investments were funded from personal resources, highlighting limited access
to outside capital and underscoring the need for improved financial support mechanisms.
Effects on input use, yields, and farm profitability
The crisis led to varied impacts on input use, yields, and profitability across different agricultural sectors.
Rising fertilizer and fuel prices prompted farmers to reduce input use; for instance, pepper farmers
decreased NPK fertilizer usage by 21.3 percent. Yields fluctuated from sector to sector: wheat yields
initially increased but later declined by 7.7 percent in 2023, pepper yields consistently fell, and vineyard
yields saw a significant drop of 24.2 percent in 2023. Conversely, raspberry yields remained relatively
stable, and milk yields per cow increased by 4.4 percent in 2023. Farm profitability also varied; while
the pepper and dairy sectors experienced substantial gains due to higher product prices and efficiency
improvements, the raspberry and vineyard sectors faced declines attributed to increased production
costs and market pressures, including competition from Ukrainian imports affecting raspberry prices.
Overall, the mean gross margin per farm increased, but the median gross margin decreased, indicating
disparities in profitability among farmers.
Attitudes toward sustainable farming
Farmers had mixed attitudes toward adopting sustainable and innovative farming practices. While some
were open, particularly raspberry farmers due to market demand for sustainable products, a significant
portion, especially vineyard farmers, were reluctant to adopt precision farming technologies. Economic
barriers, limited awareness, and adherence to traditional practices contributed to this hesitation. Vertical
value chain coordination remained relatively stable, with many farmers maintaining consistent relations
with buyers, although the crisis strained some of these relations, notably in the wheat and pepper
sectors. Horizontal cooperation was limited, with only 17.9percent of farmers participating in organized
groups, with willingness to engage more in the future being moderate. Access to advisory services was
limited; 42 percent of farmers have received advice in the past five years, primarily from input suppliers
and private consultants. However, 58 percent did not access these services due to a perceived lack of
need, while a significant majority were unwilling to pay for expert advice, reflecting a gap in knowledge
support for sustainable practices.

Impact on food security
The crisis prompted farmers in Kosovo to increase domestic production of staple crops to enhance food
security and reduce reliance on imports. Wheat production rose from 280 616 tonnes in 2018 to 330 913
tonnes in 2022, improving self-sufficiency from 57 percent to nearly 70 percent. Maize production also
increased, reaching over 81percent self-sufficiency in 2022. These efforts strengthened food security
amid global disruptions; however, the continued dependence on imported inputs and exposure to price
fluctuations remain challenges. Farmers retained more of their production for household consumption,
reflecting concerns over food availability and the need for self-sufficiency.
Migration trends and labour availability
The crisis intensified migration from rural areas, exacerbating labor shortages in the agricultural sector.
The average annual rate of households with migrants increased from 1.83 percent between 2012 and 2018
to 3.40 percent between 2019 and 2023. The pepper and vineyard sectors experienced significant hikes in
migration rates, while the wheat sector saw a decrease, possibly due to government support measures.
Cumulatively, 46.0 percent of vineyard and 43.0 percent of pepper farming households had at least one
member in migration, highlighting substantial labor outflows. The dairy sector faced severe decline,
with a 47.2 percent reduction in farming households between 2019 and 2023. These trends underscore
the vulnerability of rural communities and the need for policies to support rural livelihoods and stabilize
agricultural employment.
Farming strategies and willingness to continue farming
Farmers showed a preference for stability and diversification within familiar domains rather than significant
changes or relocation. While 41 percent considered engaging in non-farm work, a majority were reluctant
to expand their farms or migrate. Dairy farmers were the most open to diversification, whereas vineyard
farmers were resistant to expanding land ownership or migrating. Succession planning revealed that
over half of the farmers were undecided or lacked a designated successor, with a notable gender
imbalance favoring male successors. Investment intentions varied, with 47.6 percent planning to invest
in their operations. Dairy farmers led in planned investments, focusing on infrastructure and efficiency
improvements, while vineyard farmers were least inclined to invest due to high cost or uncertain returns.
Barriers to investment included economic constraints, labor shortages, and limited government support.
Impact on agricultural competitiveness
The agrifood sector in Kosovo demonstrated resilience, with exports growing from EUR 41.68 million
in 2015 to EUR 147.99 million in 2023. However, imports also increased, sustaining a substantial trade
deficit despite an improved export-to-import coverage ratio. The crisis exposed vulnerabilities such
as dependency on imported inputs and sensitivity to global market fluctuations. Export prices nearly
doubled, but trade terms declined, indicating import prices rising faster than export prices, resulting
in reduced purchasing power. The influx of Ukrainian agricultural products into the European Union
intensified competition, impacting particularly raspberry exports in the form of reduced prices and
revenue potential for farmers. These factors highlight the need to strengthen competitive positioning,
improve production efficiency, and reduce reliance on imports.
Farmers' perceptions of policy support
Farmers had mixed perceptions of government policy support during the crisis. While financial assistance
to manage rising operational costs was appreciated, many farmers felt current measures were
insufficient, particularly in supporting new technology adoption and environmentally friendly practices.
Climate change, labor shortages, and high fertilizer costs were identified as the most pressing challenges.
Investment Grants were overwhelmingly favored as the top support instrument, indicating a need for
long-term investments in infrastructure and technology. Demand for better-targeted input subsidies, risk
protection, and income support to enhance sectoral resilience was also present. Farmers took a neutral
position regarding support to cover increasing costs but showed dissatisfaction with assistance for adopting
new technologies and sustainable practices, suggesting areas for policy improvement.

RECOMMENDATIONS
To address the identified challenges, the report proposes several recommendations:
1. Tailored Policies for Striving Sectors
Specific policies to stabilize and revitalize the vineyard and raspberry sectors are needed. It is essential
to assess the financial viability of small and medium-sized farms in the vineyard sector and the
importance developing policy responses in the wine sector, including transitional measures for specific
support. Addressing market volatility in the raspberry sector through the exploration of private (market)
and public risk protection mechanisms, such as insurance and diversification, and through the adoption
of effective policies to manage price fluctuations and support farmers is essential.
2. Measures to enhance sustainability
Implementing long-term (strategic) measures can improve overall agriculture sustainability in Kosovo,
aligning it with the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and enhancing resilience.
Reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers and implement cross-compliance measures:
(i) encourage soil testing every three years for efficient fertilizer use,
(ii) link direct payments to compliance with measures like soil testing, maintaining fertilizer records,
adopting Integrated Pest Management practices,
(iii) strengthen regulations to ensure quality fertilizers and plant protection products,
(iv) promote organic fertilizers through awareness and training to support soil health,
(v) encourage innovation such as precision farming, biological pest control, and drone use for
sustainable practices, (vi) implement animal welfare policies by conditioning support on
adherence to standards.
Addressing climate change: (i) develop policies to adopt crop varieties resistant to heat, humidity, pests,
and diseases to improve farming adaptability, (ii) improve insurance schemes to better compensate
farmers for damages from extreme weather conditions, ensuring they are protected against climate-
related losses.
With the implementation of these recommendations, Kosovo can enhance agricultural sustainability,
improve resilience against crises, and align its practices with the European Union CAP and Green Deal
agendas. This comprehensive approach would strengthen the entire agricultural sector, leveraging
current momentum despite the focus on the vineyard and raspberry sectors.

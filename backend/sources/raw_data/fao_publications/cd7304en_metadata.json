Land use per\nfarm increased 8.7 percent, from 5.73 has in 2019 to 6.23 has in 2023, primarily through additional land\nleasing to maintain flexibility amidst market volatility. Labor usage saw a modest rise of 6.4 percent, with\na notable 62.6 percent increase in full-time employed labor, reflecting efforts to secure a stable workforce\ndespite labor shortages and increased competition from other sectors. Wages for agricultural labor also\nsurged, with daily wages increasing by 57.9 percent and monthly wages\nby 24.7 percent, exacerbating financial pressures on farmers.\nCapital utilization was subject to adjustments because of soaring input costs; many farmers reduced\nchemical fertilizer application and faced escalating machinery expenses due to high fuel prices. Despite\nthese challenges, farmers continued to invest an average of EUR 23 529 per farm in their operations,\nindicating a proactive approach to enhancing productivity and adapting to market conditions. However,\nover 90 percent of these investments were funded from personal resources, highlighting limited access\nto outside capital and underscoring the need for improved financial support mechanisms.\nEffects on input use, yields, and farm profitability\nThe crisis led to varied impacts on input use, yields, and profitability across different agricultural sectors.\nRising fertilizer and fuel prices prompted farmers to reduce input use; for instance, pepper farmers\ndecreased NPK fertilizer usage by 21.3 percent. Yields fluctuated from sector to sector: wheat yields\ninitially increased but later declined by 7.7 percent in 2023, pepper yields consistently fell, and vineyard\nyields saw a significant drop of 24.2 percent in 2023. Conversely, raspberry yields remained relatively\nstable, and milk yields per cow increased by 4.4 percent in 2023. Farm profitability also varied; while\nthe pepper and dairy sectors experienced substantial gains due to higher product prices and efficiency\nimprovements, the raspberry and vineyard sectors faced declines attributed to increased production\ncosts and market pressures, including competition from Ukrainian imports affecting raspberry prices.\nOverall, the mean gross margin per farm increased, but the median gross margin decreased, indicating\ndisparities in profitability among farmers.\nAttitudes toward sustainable farming\nFarmers had mixed attitudes toward adopting sustainable and innovative farming practices. While some\nwere open, particularly raspberry farmers due to market demand for sustainable products, a significant\nportion, especially vineyard farmers, were reluctant to adopt precision farming technologies. Economic\nbarriers, limited awareness, and adherence to traditional practices contributed to this hesitation. Vertical\nvalue chain coordination remained relatively stable, with many farmers maintaining consistent relations\nwith buyers, although the crisis strained some of these relations, notably in the wheat and pepper\nsectors. Horizontal cooperation was limited, with only 17.9percent of farmers participating in organized\ngroups, with willingness to engage more in the future being moderate. Access to advisory services was\nlimited; 42 percent of farmers have received advice in the past five years, primarily from input suppliers\nand private consultants. However, 58 percent did not access these services due to a perceived lack of\nneed, while a significant majority were unwilling to pay for expert advice, reflecting a gap in knowledge\nsupport for sustainable practices.\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nix\nImpact on food security\nThe crisis prompted farmers in Kosovo to increase domestic production of staple crops to enhance food\nsecurity and reduce reliance on imports. Wheat production rose from 280 616 tonnes in 2018 to 330 913\ntonnes in 2022, improving self-sufficiency from 57 percent to nearly 70 percent. Maize production also\nincreased, reaching over 81percent self-sufficiency in 2022. These efforts strengthened food security\namid global disruptions; however, the continued dependence on imported inputs and exposure to price\nfluctuations remain challenges. Farmers retained more of their production for household consumption,\nreflecting concerns over food availability and the need for self-sufficiency.\nMigration trends and labour availability\nThe crisis intensified migration from rural areas, exacerbating labor shortages in the agricultural sector.\nThe average annual rate of households with migrants increased from 1.83 percent between 2012 and 2018\nto 3.40 percent between 2019 and 2023. The pepper and vineyard sectors experienced significant hikes in\nmigration rates, while the wheat sector saw a decrease, possibly due to government support measures.\nCumulatively, 46.0 percent of vineyard and 43.0 percent of pepper farming households had at least one\nmember in migration, highlighting substantial labor outflows. The dairy sector faced severe decline,\nwith a 47.2 percent reduction in farming households between 2019 and 2023. These trends underscore\nthe vulnerability of rural communities and the need for policies to support rural livelihoods and stabilize\nagricultural employment.\nFarming strategies and willingness to continue farming\nFarmers showed a preference for stability and diversification within familiar domains rather than significant\nchanges or relocation. While 41 percent considered engaging in non-farm work, a majority were reluctant\nto expand their farms or migrate. Dairy farmers were the most open to diversification, whereas vineyard\nfarmers were resistant to expanding land ownership or migrating. Succession planning revealed that\nover half of the farmers were undecided or lacked a designated successor, with a notable gender\nimbalance favoring male successors. Investment intentions varied, with 47.6 percent planning to invest\nin their operations. Dairy farmers led in planned investments, focusing on infrastructure and efficiency\nimprovements, while vineyard farmers were least inclined to invest due to high cost or uncertain returns.\nBarriers to investment included economic constraints, labor shortages, and limited government support.\nImpact on agricultural competitiveness\nThe agrifood sector in Kosovo demonstrated resilience, with exports growing from EUR 41.68 million\nin 2015 to EUR 147.99 million in 2023. However, imports also increased, sustaining a substantial trade\ndeficit despite an improved export-to-import coverage ratio. The crisis exposed vulnerabilities such\nas dependency on imported inputs and sensitivity to global market fluctuations. Export prices nearly\ndoubled, but trade terms declined, indicating import prices rising faster than export prices, resulting\nin reduced purchasing power. The influx of Ukrainian agricultural products into the European Union\nintensified competition, impacting particularly raspberry exports in the form of reduced prices and\nrevenue potential for farmers. These factors highlight the need to strengthen competitive positioning,\nimprove production efficiency, and reduce reliance on imports.\nFarmers' perceptions of policy support\nFarmers had mixed perceptions of government policy support during the crisis. While financial assistance\nto manage rising operational costs was appreciated, many farmers felt current measures were\ninsufficient, particularly in supporting new technology adoption and environmentally friendly practices.\nClimate change, labor shortages, and high fertilizer costs were identified as the most pressing challenges.\nInvestment Grants were overwhelmingly favored as the top support instrument, indicating a need for\nlong-term investments in infrastructure and technology. Demand for better-targeted input subsidies, risk\nprotection, and income support to enhance sectoral resilience was also present. Farmers took a neutral\nposition regarding support to cover increasing costs but showed dissatisfaction with assistance for adopting\nnew technologies and sustainable practices, suggesting areas for policy improvement.\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nx\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nTo address the identified challenges, the report proposes several recommendations:\n1. Tailored Policies for Striving Sectors\nSpecific policies to stabilize and revitalize the vineyard and raspberry sectors are needed. It is essential\nto assess the financial viability of small and medium-sized farms in the vineyard sector and the\nimportance developing policy responses in the wine sector, including transitional measures for specific\nsupport. Addressing market volatility in the raspberry sector through the exploration of private (market)\nand public risk protection mechanisms, such as insurance and diversification, and through the adoption\nof effective policies to manage price fluctuations and support farmers is essential.\n2. Measures to enhance sustainability\nImplementing long-term (strategic) measures can improve overall agriculture sustainability in Kosovo,\naligning it with the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and enhancing resilience.\nReducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers and implement cross-compliance measures:\n(i) encourage soil testing every three years for efficient fertilizer use,\n(ii) link direct payments to compliance with measures like soil testing, maintaining fertilizer records,\nadopting Integrated Pest Management practices,\n(iii) strengthen regulations to ensure quality fertilizers and plant protection products,\n(iv) promote organic fertilizers through awareness and training to support soil health,\n(v) encourage innovation such as precision farming, biological pest control, and drone use for\nsustainable practices, (vi) implement animal welfare policies by conditioning support on\nadherence to standards.\nAddressing climate change: (i) develop policies to adopt crop varieties resistant to heat, humidity, pests,\nand diseases to improve farming adaptability, (ii) improve insurance schemes to better compensate\nfarmers for damages from extreme weather conditions, ensuring they are protected against climate-\nrelated losses.\nWith the implementation of these recommendations, Kosovo can enhance agricultural sustainability,\nimprove resilience against crises, and align its practices with the European Union CAP and Green Deal\nagendas. This comprehensive approach would strengthen the entire agricultural sector, leveraging\ncurrent momentum despite the focus on the vineyard and raspberry sectors.\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n1.

Land use per\nfarm increased 8.7 percent, from 5.73 has in 2019 to 6.23 has in 2023, primarily through additional land\nleasing to maintain flexibility amidst market volatility. Labor usage saw a modest rise of 6.4 percent, with\na notable 62.6 percent increase in full-time employed labor, reflecting efforts to secure a stable workforce\ndespite labor shortages and increased competition from other sectors. Wages for agricultural labor also\nsurged, with daily wages increasing by 57.9 percent and monthly wages\nby 24.7 percent, exacerbating financial pressures on farmers.\nCapital utilization was subject to adjustments because of soaring input costs; many farmers reduced\nchemical fertilizer application and faced escalating machinery expenses due to high fuel prices. Despite\nthese challenges, farmers continued to invest an average of EUR 23 529 per farm in their operations,\nindicating a proactive approach to enhancing productivity and adapting to market conditions. However,\nover 90 percent of these investments were funded from personal resources, highlighting limited access\nto outside capital and underscoring the need for improved financial support mechanisms.\nEffects on input use, yields, and farm profitability\nThe crisis led to varied impacts on input use, yields, and profitability across different agricultural sectors.\nRising fertilizer and fuel prices prompted farmers to reduce input use; for instance, pepper farmers\ndecreased NPK fertilizer usage by 21.3 percent. Yields fluctuated from sector to sector: wheat yields\ninitially increased but later declined by 7.7 percent in 2023, pepper yields consistently fell, and vineyard\nyields saw a significant drop of 24.2 percent in 2023. Conversely, raspberry yields remained relatively\nstable, and milk yields per cow increased by 4.4 percent in 2023. Farm profitability also varied; while\nthe pepper and dairy sectors experienced substantial gains due to higher product prices and efficiency\nimprovements, the raspberry and vineyard sectors faced declines attributed to increased production\ncosts and market pressures, including competition from Ukrainian imports affecting raspberry prices.\nOverall, the mean gross margin per farm increased, but the median gross margin decreased, indicating\ndisparities in profitability among farmers.\nAttitudes toward sustainable farming\nFarmers had mixed attitudes toward adopting sustainable and innovative farming practices. While some\nwere open, particularly raspberry farmers due to market demand for sustainable products, a significant\nportion, especially vineyard farmers, were reluctant to adopt precision farming technologies. Economic\nbarriers, limited awareness, and adherence to traditional practices contributed to this hesitation. Vertical\nvalue chain coordination remained relatively stable, with many farmers maintaining consistent relations\nwith buyers, although the crisis strained some of these relations, notably in the wheat and pepper\nsectors. Horizontal cooperation was limited, with only 17.9percent of farmers participating in organized\ngroups, with willingness to engage more in the future being moderate. Access to advisory services was\nlimited; 42 percent of farmers have received advice in the past five years, primarily from input suppliers\nand private consultants. However, 58 percent did not access these services due to a perceived lack of\nneed, while a significant majority were unwilling to pay for expert advice, reflecting a gap in knowledge\nsupport for sustainable practices.\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nix\nImpact on food security\nThe crisis prompted farmers in Kosovo to increase domestic production of staple crops to enhance food\nsecurity and reduce reliance on imports. Wheat production rose from 280 616 tonnes in 2018 to 330 913\ntonnes in 2022, improving self-sufficiency from 57 percent to nearly 70 percent. Maize production also\nincreased, reaching over 81percent self-sufficiency in 2022. These efforts strengthened food security\namid global disruptions; however, the continued dependence on imported inputs and exposure to price\nfluctuations remain challenges. Farmers retained more of their production for household consumption,\nreflecting concerns over food availability and the need for self-sufficiency.\nMigration trends and labour availability\nThe crisis intensified migration from rural areas, exacerbating labor shortages in the agricultural sector.\nThe average annual rate of households with migrants increased from 1.83 percent between 2012 and 2018\nto 3.40 percent between 2019 and 2023. The pepper and vineyard sectors experienced significant hikes in\nmigration rates, while the wheat sector saw a decrease, possibly due to government support measures.\nCumulatively, 46.0 percent of vineyard and 43.0 percent of pepper farming households had at least one\nmember in migration, highlighting substantial labor outflows. The dairy sector faced severe decline,\nwith a 47.2 percent reduction in farming households between 2019 and 2023. These trends underscore\nthe vulnerability of rural communities and the need for policies to support rural livelihoods and stabilize\nagricultural employment.\nFarming strategies and willingness to continue farming\nFarmers showed a preference for stability and diversification within familiar domains rather than significant\nchanges or relocation. While 41 percent considered engaging in non-farm work, a majority were reluctant\nto expand their farms or migrate. Dairy farmers were the most open to diversification, whereas vineyard\nfarmers were resistant to expanding land ownership or migrating. Succession planning revealed that\nover half of the farmers were undecided or lacked a designated successor, with a notable gender\nimbalance favoring male successors. Investment intentions varied, with 47.6 percent planning to invest\nin their operations. Dairy farmers led in planned investments, focusing on infrastructure and efficiency\nimprovements, while vineyard farmers were least inclined to invest due to high cost or uncertain returns.\nBarriers to investment included economic constraints, labor shortages, and limited government support.\nImpact on agricultural competitiveness\nThe agrifood sector in Kosovo demonstrated resilience, with exports growing from EUR 41.68 million\nin 2015 to EUR 147.99 million in 2023. However, imports also increased, sustaining a substantial trade\ndeficit despite an improved export-to-import coverage ratio. The crisis exposed vulnerabilities such\nas dependency on imported inputs and sensitivity to global market fluctuations. Export prices nearly\ndoubled, but trade terms declined, indicating import prices rising faster than export prices, resulting\nin reduced purchasing power. The influx of Ukrainian agricultural products into the European Union\nintensified competition, impacting particularly raspberry exports in the form of reduced prices and\nrevenue potential for farmers. These factors highlight the need to strengthen competitive positioning,\nimprove production efficiency, and reduce reliance on imports.\nFarmers' perceptions of policy support\nFarmers had mixed perceptions of government policy support during the crisis. While financial assistance\nto manage rising operational costs was appreciated, many farmers felt current measures were\ninsufficient, particularly in supporting new technology adoption and environmentally friendly practices.\nClimate change, labor shortages, and high fertilizer costs were identified as the most pressing challenges.\nInvestment Grants were overwhelmingly favored as the top support instrument, indicating a need for\nlong-term investments in infrastructure and technology. Demand for better-targeted input subsidies, risk\nprotection, and income support to enhance sectoral resilience was also present. Farmers took a neutral\nposition regarding support to cover increasing costs but showed dissatisfaction with assistance for adopting\nnew technologies and sustainable practices, suggesting areas for policy improvement.\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nx\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nTo address the identified challenges, the report proposes several recommendations:\n1. Tailored Policies for Striving Sectors\nSpecific policies to stabilize and revitalize the vineyard and raspberry sectors are needed. It is essential\nto assess the financial viability of small and medium-sized farms in the vineyard sector and the\nimportance developing policy responses in the wine sector, including transitional measures for specific\nsupport. Addressing market volatility in the raspberry sector through the exploration of private (market)\nand public risk protection mechanisms, such as insurance and diversification, and through the adoption\nof effective policies to manage price fluctuations and support farmers is essential.\n2. Measures to enhance sustainability\nImplementing long-term (strategic) measures can improve overall agriculture sustainability in Kosovo,\naligning it with the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and enhancing resilience.\nReducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers and implement cross-compliance measures:\n(i) encourage soil testing every three years for efficient fertilizer use,\n(ii) link direct payments to compliance with measures like soil testing, maintaining fertilizer records,\nadopting Integrated Pest Management practices,\n(iii) strengthen regulations to ensure quality fertilizers and plant protection products,\n(iv) promote organic fertilizers through awareness and training to support soil health,\n(v) encourage innovation such as precision farming, biological pest control, and drone use for\nsustainable practices, (vi) implement animal welfare policies by conditioning support on\nadherence to standards.\nAddressing climate change: (i) develop policies to adopt crop varieties resistant to heat, humidity, pests,\nand diseases to improve farming adaptability, (ii) improve insurance schemes to better compensate\nfarmers for damages from extreme weather conditions, ensuring they are protected against climate-\nrelated losses.\nWith the implementation of these recommendations, Kosovo can enhance agricultural sustainability,\nimprove resilience against crises, and align its practices with the European Union CAP and Green Deal\nagendas. This comprehensive approach would strengthen the entire agricultural sector, leveraging\ncurrent momentum despite the focus on the vineyard and raspberry sectors.\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n1.
